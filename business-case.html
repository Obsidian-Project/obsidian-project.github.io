        <h1>Business Case</h1>
        <h4 class="subtitle">The sugar cane industry in Mexico</h4>
        <p>The sugarcane cultivation in Mexico, generates approximately 1 million direct jobs and 2.2 million indirect jobs
            in 15 states and 227 municipalities (9.2% of all municipalities in Mexico).
        </p>
        <p class="withPadding">
            According to estimates, sugarcane production generates dividends of approximately
            <span>2 billion dollars</span> and positively impacts more than 12 million people.
        </p>
        <p class="withPadding">On average, a normal farmer producer owns approximately 5 or less hectares of land in suburbs and rural communities,
            this represents a 76.3 % of the total acreage, while 18.8% is distributed in areas between 5.1 and 10 hectares,
            and only 4.9% occurs in areas larger than 10 hectares.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>By considering aspects of production by hectare of land, 1 hectare of land produces from 60 to 70 tons of sugar cane
            and the payment for every ton by August of 2017 was approximately 32 pounds. It means that an average farmer
            with 5 hectares has an income of approximately 11,200 pounds per year. This without considering payment to workers,
            cost of tools and other items like fertilizers and herbicides.</p>
        <p class="withPadding">In contrast, the average price of a tractor is about 20,000 pounds, the price can vary because the vendors are normally
            from the United States and the price is set in US currency(USD). It means that the cost of acquiring agricultural
            machinery, that can improve productivity and decrease costs, it is not afordable to an average farmer.
