        <h1>Inclusive asset sharing platform for small farmers in rural areas</h1>
        <p>In the world there are approximately 500 million of small farmers without enough resources to acquire agricultural
            equipment that could empower their activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Obsidian</span> combines the lessons learned from different financial services in rural environments and Blockchain
            technology to create a unique solution that we believe is going to support the development of rural ecosystems.

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Designing products and services for rural environments could face different kind of problems, for instance the levels
            of literacy of the potential customers can make difficult the adoption of new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>In order to get a broader understanding of the people we are designing for. We followed a user-centred approach that
            help us uncover important insights about the social networks mechanisms and dynamics in rural communities.

        <h5>Obsidian for Governments
        </h5>
        <p>The asset sharing provides a viable strategy, so that governments could achieve a higher number of mechanisation
            of land with a smaller number of agricultural equipment units.
        </p>
        <h5>Obsidian for leasing companies
        </h5>
        <p>Our asset sharing model will enable leasing companies to access a price sensitive customer segment and expand their
            market.</p>
